# Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database

A repository for the breast cancer research project in ATU Programming for Data Analytics 2022. I have listed here the project requirements given by the lecturer, as well as my referencing and the initial queries I ran. All of my explanations of the dataset are given in the [Jupyter Notebook](assignment.ipynb) that is contained within this repository.

## Task

- Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background
- Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance
- Present a statistical analysis of the dataset
- Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.
- Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature
- Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints
