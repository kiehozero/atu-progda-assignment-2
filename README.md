# Programming for Data Analysis Assignment 2

A repository for the breast cancer research project in ATU Programming for Data Analytics 2022. I have listed here the project requirements given by the lecturer, as well as my referencing and the initial queries I ran. All of my explanations of the dataset are given in the [Jupyter Notebook](assignment.ipynb) that is contained within this repository.
